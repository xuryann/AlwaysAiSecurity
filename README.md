# AlwaysAiSecurity
Within high-end retail stores, security guards are notorious for being extra cautious towards people outside of their regular consumer demographic. In particular, these people are people of color and the poor.

AlwaysAiSecurity removes this stigma and allows all consumers to enjoy their shopping experiences regardless of their demographics through the use of Raspberry Pi, its camera and sensor, and edgeIQ API. With these tools, AlwaysAiSecurity uses computer vision to identify where valuable merchandise is at all times so specific individuals are not targeted. If the items are moved outside of the frame of the technology, it will notify the retailer so they can address the issue.
